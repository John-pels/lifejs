Initial release of the Life.js Compiler! ðŸŽ‰ All the complex typesafety wiring is now automatically handled by the compiler at build-time, and the framework exposes simple `useAgent()` and `createAgentClient()` helpers. The compiler supports incremental rebuild and watch mode (10-200ms for a hot rebuild on average).
