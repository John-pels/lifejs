title: Retrieval (RAG)
description: Lorem
---

While Life.js doesn't any specific way of doing RAG, it also exposes a `life.js/retrieval` package
that plugs into the core storage configuration and allows to perform simple semantic search.
So if your retrieval use case is simple, you don't have to bring a complex third party provider and 
can control the retrieval logic on your own.

Here is how you can use it in a memory:

`my-agent/memories/fun-facts.ts`
```ts
import { defineMemory } from "@live-js/core";
import { defineRetrieval } from "@live-js/retrieval";

// If you want to use that 
const funFactsRetrieval = defineRetrieval({
  id: "fun-facts",
  metadata: {
    userId: z.string(),
  },
});

await funFactsRetrieval.saveItem({
    content: "The user is named John",
    metadata: {
        userId: "123",
    }
})
// you can also use saveItems() to save multiple items at once

const funFacts = await funFactsRetrieval.searchItems({
    content: "The user is named John",
    topK: 10,
})
```
