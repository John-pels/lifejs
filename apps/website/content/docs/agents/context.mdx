One of the main challenges that Life.js aim to solve is breaking out the traditional chatbot experience.

We believe that while chatbots will remain useful in many cases, some applications will embrace more
native and intuitive agentic experiences, where the agent is melted into the application.

Until then, most agents framework forced you to organize your messages between the agent and the users
by resource (e.g., userId) and thread (e.g. conversationId). 

Life.js brings a less opinionated approach to contexts, where you can still segment by resource and thread
if you want to, but can also choose, per-agent, totally different segmentations.

Here are some examples of what that unlocks:

- `context: {userId, chatId}` for a traditional chat experience
- `context: {userId}` for a boundless agent experience, the user\<>agent interaction is infinite and not bound to a specific chat or topic.
- `context: {userId, orgId}` for a boundless agent experience bound to a specific organization (in case the user can have multiple organizations)
- or even `context: {orgId}` for a context shared by all the members of an organization
- `context: {userId, articleId}` to bound interactions to a specific article (e.g., your a newspaper with a reading assistant)
- `context: {userId, date}` to segmenent interactions by day
- etc.


Another cool things with contexts, is that if multiple agents use the same keys, they are merged, so let's say
- Agent A is using: `context: {userId, orgId}`
- And Agent B is using: `context: {userId, orgId, articleId}`
- You can then query the context table to retrieve all the contexts for the `userId` no matter the `orgId` and `articleId`. Well it's flexible
