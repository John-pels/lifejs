# Installation

Whether you're starting from scratch or adding Life.js to an existing project, we recommend running:

```npm
npx life init
```

You'll be guided through setting up your Life.js project.

This includes:
- Setting up a React project if not already (with Next.js, Vite, etc.)
- Configuring your AI IDE (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) to work with Life.js
- Installing required dependencies
- Creating an example agent

Time to bring your ideas to life!

## Manual Installation ((folded by default))
In case you prefer to install Life.js manually, here are the steps:

1. Setup your React project if not already:
- With Next.js
- With Vite

2. Install Life.js:
```npm
npm install life
```

3. Create a `life.config.ts` file in the root of your project:
```ts
import { defineConfig } from "life/config";

export default defineConfig();
```

4. Create a `agents` directory in the root of your project, with an `example` agent in it:
```bash
mkdir agents/example
```

5. Define the example agent:
```bash
touch agents/example/server.ts
```
```ts
import { defineAgent } from "life/define";
export default defineAgent("example");
```

6. Copy the following instructions for your AI IDE
- Claude Code
- Cursor
- Codex
- Antigravity

7. Perform a first compilation of your agents:
```bash
life build
```
